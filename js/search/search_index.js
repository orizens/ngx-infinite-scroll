It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! &#x1F60A;\nWe welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with \n\nQA: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)\nMarketing: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...\nCommunity: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...\nCode: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.\nMoney: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective.\n\nYour First Contribution\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub.\nSubmitting code\nAny code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.\nCode review process\nThe bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.\nIt is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?\nFinancial contributions\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective.\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions, create an issue (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).\nYou can also reach us at hello@ngx-infinite-scroll.opencollective.com.\nCredits\nContributors\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to ngx-infinite-scroll!\n\nBackers\nThank you to all our backers!

to easily reflect compatibility.Meaning, for Angular 9, use ngx-infinite-scroll @ ^9.0.0\nAngular - Older Versions Support\nFor Angular 6 and Above - ngx-infinite-scroll@THE_VERSION.0.0For Angular 4 and Angular = ^5.5.6 - use version ngx-infinite-scroll@0.8.4For Angular 5.x with rxjs = - use version ngx-infinite-scroll@0.8.3For Angular version , you can use npm i angular2-infinite-scroll (latest version is 0.3.42) - please notice the angular2-infinite-scroll package is deprecated\nUsed By\n\nGoogle\nApple\nAmazon\nMicrosoft\nDisney\nSap\nCisco\nYandex\nAncestry\n\nand much more.\n\nThese

the infinite-scroll container (i.e, 2 (2 * 10 = 20%) is event is triggered when 80% (100% - 20%) has been scrolled). if container.height is 900px, when the container is scrolled to or past the 720px, it will fire the scrolled event.\n\n\ninfiniteScrollUpDistance\nnumber\noptional\n1.5\nshould get a number\n\n\ninfiniteScrollThrottle\nnumber\noptional\n150\nshould get a number of milliseconds for throttle. The event will be triggered this many milliseconds after the user stops scrolling.\n\n\nscrollWindow\nboolean\noptional\ntrue\nlistens to the window scroll instead of the actual element scroll. this allows to invoke a callback function in the scope of the element while listenning to the window scroll.\n\n\nimmediateCheck\nboolean\noptional\nfalse\ninvokes the handler immediately to check if a scroll event has been already triggred when the page has been loaded (i.e. - when you refresh a page that has been scrolled)\n\n\ninfiniteScrollDisabled\nboolean\noptional\nfalse\ndoesn't invoke the handler if set to true\n\n\nhorizontal\nboolean\noptional\nfalse\nsets the scroll to listen for horizontal events\n\n\nalwaysCallback\nboolean\noptional\nfalse\ninstructs the scroller to always trigger events\n\n\ninfiniteScrollContainer\nstring / HTMLElement\noptional\nnull\nshould get a html element or css selector for a scrollable element; window or current element will be used if this attribute is empty.\n\n\nfromRoot\nboolean\noptional\nfalse\nif infiniteScrollContainer is set, this instructs the scroller to query the container selector from the root of the document object.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n@Output()\nType\nEvent Type\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nscrolled\nEventEmitter\nIInfiniteScrollEvent\noptional\nthis will callback if the distance threshold has been reached on a scroll down.\n\n\nscrolledUp\nEventEmitter\nIInfiniteScrollEvent\noptional\nthis will callback if the distance threshold has been reached on a scroll up.\n\n\n\nBehavior\nBy default, the directive listens to the window scroll event and invoked the callback.To trigger the callback when the actual element is scrolled, these settings should be configured:\n\n[scrollWindow]=\"false\"\nset an explict css \"height\" value to the element\n\nDEMO\nTry the Demo in StackBlitz\nUsage\nFirst, import the InfiniteScrollModule to your module:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { InfiniteScrollModule } from 'ngx-infinite-scroll';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [BrowserModule, InfiniteScrollModule],\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);In this example, the onScroll callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled down:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  template: `\n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log('scrolled!!');\n  }\n}in this example, whenever the \"search-results\" is scrolled, the callback will be invoked:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  styles: [\n    `\n      .search-results {\n        height: 20rem;\n        overflow: scroll;\n      }\n    `,\n  ],\n  template: `\n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log('scrolled!!');\n  }\n}In this example, the onScrollDown callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled down and the onScrollUp callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled up:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { InfiniteScroll } from 'ngx-infinite-scroll';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  directives: [InfiniteScroll],\n  template: `\n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScrollDown() {\n    console.log('scrolled down!!');\n  }\n\n  onScrollUp() {\n    console.log('scrolled up!!');\n  }\n}In this example, the infiniteScrollContainer attribute is used to point directive to the scrollable container using a css selector. fromRoot is used to determine whether the scroll container has to be searched within the whole document ([fromRoot]=\"true\") or just inside the infiniteScroll directive ([fromRoot]=\"false\", default option).\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  styles: [\n    `\n      .main-panel {\n        height: 100px;\n        overflow-y: scroll;\n      }\n    `,\n  ],\n  template: `\n    \n      \n    \n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  selector: string = '.main-panel';\n\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log('scrolled!!');\n  }\n}It is also possible to use infiniteScrollContainer without additional variable by using single quotes inside double quotes:\n[infiniteScrollContainer]=\"'.main-panel'\"Showcase Examples\n\nEchoes Player - Developed with Angular, angular-cli and ngrx (github repo for echoes player)\n\nContributors\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
